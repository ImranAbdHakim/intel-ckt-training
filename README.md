        * constant height for all cells in a same technology
        * can have several version for different fan-out driving capability

      * **Full custom design**
        * done without any library by designers
        * layouts, orientation, placement of transistor done by designers
        * developement cost is high

  **VLSI Design Quality**  
    * **Testability**  
      Design of testable chip  
    * **Yield and Manufacturability**  
      Yield: No. of tested of chips/Total no. of Chips    
      Functional Yield: Checks at lower speed  
      Parametric Yield: Checks at required speed
    * **Reliability**  
      ESD, EOS, Electromigration, Oxide breakdown, Power and ground bouncing, On-chip noise and cross-talk.
    * **Technology Upgradability**  
      Design style must be flexible to technology update so that the design can be use back with minimal cost. 
      Use advanced CAD tools to automatically generate physical layout.
  
  **Package Technology**
    -Chip designers should work closely with package designers to consider various packaging constraints, parasitic, length of bonding wire, no. of bonding pads.  
    * **Classification of Package**  
    * Pin-through-hole (PTH): holes drilled in PCB, not cost effective but soldering process in not inexpensive.
    * Surface Mount Technology (SMT): Directly soldered on the PCB, cost and space effective but expensive equipment's are needed for soldering
    * Plastic: Dominant for many years but it has the disadvantage of being permeable to environmental moisture.
    * Ceramic: Power consumption, performance and environmental requirements

**Analog IC Design Process**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/211587318-48f31c1d-7a70-48c1-90a8-fa2c5472582c.png)

| Electrical Design | Physical Design | Test Design |  
| --- | --- | --- |
| process of going from the specification to a circuit solution | process of representing the electrical design in a layout consisting of many distinct geometrical rectangle at various levels | process of coordinating, planning and implementing the measurement of the analog integrated circuit performance |
| The electrical design requires active and passive device electrical models for creating the design, verifying the design and determining the robustness of the design | The physical design needs entering various geometries, follow DRC, LVS check and parasitic extraction | Types of test: Functional, Parametric, Static, Dynamic |

**Analog IC Design Process and its Relation with CAD and PDK**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/211595323-499f4d77-b1eb-47f9-8039-50dc1a877483.png)

**Role of Circuit Designer**  
 * Circuit Designer determine the implementation of the circuit which impact performance, power and cost
 * Design a practical circuit based on the device limits, technology constraints and physical implementations
 * Circuit designer should have very good understanding of layout design, so that in less iterations the design can be fridged.
 *  A good circuit designer should always discussed with the layout designer for better and efficient circuit design.
 
**CMOS Technology**  
 Why CMOS Technology?   
| Comparison Feature | BJT | MOSFET |  
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cut-off Frequency  | High | Less |
| Noise (at same thermal noise) | Less 1/f | More 1/f |
| DC Range of Operation | 9 decades of exponential current versus VBE | 2-3 decades of square law behaviour |
| Transconductance (Same Current) | Larger by 10X | Smaller by 10X |
| Small Signal Output Resistance | Slightly larger | Smaller for short channel |
| Switch Implementation | Poor | Good |
| Performance/Power Ratio | High | Low |
| Technology Improvement | Slower | Faster |
* Comparison made from digital viewpoint will side with CMOS. Since large volume mixed-mode technology will be driven by digital demands, CMOS is an obvious choice.  

**Categorization of the CMOS Technology**  
 * Submicron Technology: Lmin ≥ 0.35 µm
 * Deep Submicron Technology (DSM): 0.1 µm ≤ Lmin ≤ 0.35 µm
 * Ultra-Deep Submicron Technology (UDSM): Lmin ≤ 0.1 µm
 * BiCMOS Technology: Lmin = 0.5 µm
 
 **CMOS Fabrication Process**  
 Process Steps:
 <Details>
 <summary>1. Wafer formation (sand-to-silicon)</summary>  
 
  * The basic raw material used in CMOS fabs is a wafer or disk of silicon, roughly 75 mm to 300 mm (12 inch) in diameter and less than 1 mm thick.  
  * Wafers are cut from boules, cylindrical ingots of singlecrystal silicon, that have been pulled from a crucible of pure molten silicon.  
  * Controlled amounts of impurities are added to the melt to provide the crystal with the required electrical properties.  
  * A seed crystal is dipped into the melt to initiate crystal growth.  
  * The seed is gradually withdrawn vertically from the melt while simultaneously being rotated.  
  * The molten silicon attaches itself to the seed and recrystallizes as it is withdrawn.  
  * The seed withdrawal and rotation rates determine the diameter of the ingot.  
  * Growth rates vary from 30 to 180 mm/hour.
  </details>
  
  <Details>
  <summary>2. Photolithography</summary> 
  
  * The patterning is achieved by a process called photolithography.  
  * The primary method for defining areas of interest (i.e., where we want material to be present or absent) on a wafer is by the use of photoresists.
  * The wafer is coated with the photoresist and subjected to selective illumination through the photomask.
  * A photomask is constructed with chromium (chrome) covered quartz glass. A UV light source is used to expose the photoresist.
  * A developer solvent is then used to dissolve the soluble unexposed photoresist, leaving islands of insoluble exposed photoresist.
   </details>

  <Details>
  <summary>3. Well and Channel Formation</summary>
  
  * N-well process: In a n-well process, the pMOS transistors are built in a n-well and the nMOS transistor is placed in the p-type substrate.
  * P-well process: In a p-well process, the nMOS transistors are built in a p-well and the pMOS transistor is placed in the n-type substrate. p-well processes were used to optimize the pMOS transistor performance.
  * Twin-well process: Twin-well processes accompanied the emergence of n-well processes. A twinwell process allows the optimization of each transistor type.
  * Triple-well process: The triple-well process has emerged to provide good isolation between analog and digital blocks in mixed-signal chips; it is also used to isolate high-density dynamic memory from logic.

  </details>
 
  <Details>
  <summary>4. Silicon Dioxide (Sio2) Deposition</summary>
  
  * Oxidation of silicon is achieved by heating silicon wafers in an oxidizing atmosphere. The following are some common approaches:
  * Wet Oxidation: when the oxidizing atmosphere contains water vapor.  
   • The temperature is usually between 900 °C and 1000 °C.  
   • Wet oxidation is a rapid process.  
  * Dry Oxidation: when the oxidizing atmosphere is pure oxygen  
   • Temperatures are in the region of 1200 °C to achieve an acceptable growth rate.  
   • Dry oxidation forms a better quality oxide than wet oxidation.  
   • It is used to form thin, highly controlled gate oxides, while wet oxidation may be used to form thick field oxides.
   * Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD): when a thin chemical layer (material A) is attached to a surface and then a chemical (material B) is introduced to produce a thin layer of the required layer (i.e., SiO2––this can also be used for other various dielectrics and metals).
  </details>
 
  <Details>
  <summary>5. Isolation</summary>

  * Individual devices in a CMOS process need to be isolated from one another so that they do not have unexpected interactions.
  * The transistor gate consists of a thin gate oxide layer.
  * The thick oxide used to be formed by a process called Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS).
  * A problem with LOCOS-based processes is the transition between thick andthin oxide, which extended some distance laterally to form a so-called bird’s beak.
  * Starting around the 0.35 µm node, shallow trench isolation (STI) was introduced to avoid the problems with LOCOS.
  * STI forms insulating trenches of SiO2 surrounding the transistors (everywhere except the active area).
  </details>
 
  <Details>
  <summary>6. Gate Oxide Creation</summary>
  
 * The next step in the process is to form the gate oxide for the transistors. As mentioned, this is most commonly in the form of silicon dioxide (SiO2).The transistor gate consists of a thin gate oxide layer
  </details>
 
  <Details>
  <summary>7. Gate and Source/Drain Formations</summary>
  
  * Grow gate oxide wherever transistors are required (area = source + drain + gate)––elsewhere there will be thick oxide or trench isolation.
  * Deposit polysilicon on chip
  * Pattern polysilicon (both gates and interconnect)
  * Etch exposed gate oxide—i.e., the area of gate oxide where transistors are required that was not covered by polysilicon; at this stage, the chip has windows down to the well or substrate wherever a source/drain diffusion is required
  * Implant pMOS and nMOS source/drain regions
  </details>

 <Details>
 <summary>8. Contacts and Metallization</summary>
 
 * Contact cuts are made to source, drain, and gate according to the contact mask. These are holes etched in the dielectric after the source/drain formation.
 * Older processes commonly use aluminum (Al) for wires, although newer ones offer copper (Cu) for lower resistance.
 * Tungsten (W) can be used as a plug to fill the contact holes (to alleviate problems of aluminum not conforming to small contacts)
 </details>
 
 <Details>
 <summary>9. Passivation</summary>
 
 * The final processing step is to add a protective glass layer called passivation or over glass that prevents the ingress of contaminants.
 * Openings in the passivation layer, called overglass cuts, allow connection to I/O pads and test probe points if needed.
  </details>
  
 <Details>
 <summary>10. Metrology</summary>
 
 * Metrology is the science of measuring. Everything that is built in a semiconductor process has to be measured to give feedback to the manufacturing process.

### Theory ###
 
 **Disadvatage of Submicron CMOS**  
 Isolation of the transsistor using reverse bias pn junction is limiting the transistor size and becomes impractical
 
 **Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS) Isolation Process**  
   * Local Oxidation of Silicon is the traditional isolation technique used in submicron processes.
        1. A very thin layer silicon dioxide is grown on the wafer, called as pad oxide. Then a layer of silicon nitride is deposited which is used as an oxide barrier
        2. Then photolithography is done to pattern and etch the nitride and pad oxide where the thick oxide will be grown  
        3. Then by thermal oxidation process thick oxide is grown in the exposed area.  
        4. The last step is the removal of the silicon nitride layer.  
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/212123709-d188c4cd-5246-47e2-98ab-ef9bac0d60a5.png)   
    * The limitation of this technique is the bird’s beak effect and the surface area which is lost to this encroachment
    * The advantages of LOCOS fabrication process is simple process flow and high oxide quality because the whole LOCOS structure is thermally grown
        
 **Sallow Trench Isolation (STI) Technology**
 * Shallow trench isolation (STI) allows closer spacing of transistors by eliminating the depletion region at the surface and Bird’s beak effect due to LOCOS process.
 * Sallow Trench Isolation (STI) isolation process is the preferred isolation process for deep-submicron process because it completely avoids Bird’s beak shape characteristics.
        a. Cover the wafer with pad oxide and silicon nitride.
        b. First etch nitride and pad oxide. Next, an anisotropic etch is made in the silicon to a depth of 0.4 to 0.5 microns.
        c. Grow a thin thermal oxide layer on the trench walls
        d. A CVD dielectric film is used to fill the trench
        e. A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) step is used to polish back the dielectric layer until the nitride is reached. The nitride acts like a CMP stop layer.
        f. Densify the dielectric material at 900°C and strip the nitride and pad oxide.
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/212125269-d0d9beb3-d8e9-4408-9cd4-bd2e915f50c6.png)

  * STI is more suitable for the increased density in a small area because it allows forming smaller isolation regions.
  * The disadvantage is larger number of process steps.
        
 **Deep Submicron (DSM) CMOS Technology other uses**
   In addition to the NMOS and PMOS transistor, the DSM technology provides;
   * A deep n-well that can be utilized to reduce substrate noise coupling.
   * A MOS Varactor that can be used to make voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs).
   * Different kind of resistors like:
    * Diffused and/or implanted resistors
    * Well resistors
    * Poly resistors
    * Metal Resistors  
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/212126223-de0b33a7-7c1c-4642-8554-01fe64f1a5c4.png)  
   * At least 6 levels of metal that can form many useful structures such as inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines.
        
   **Different Types of Capacitor in DSM CMOS Technology**  
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121994033/212126490-6b055532-4a1e-49bd-b54f-7e421a1dc2fa.png)

   **Typical Deep Submicron (DSM) CMOS Fabrication Process**  
     Major Fabrication Steps for a DSM CMOS Process  
      1) p and n wells  
      2) Shallow trench isolation  
      3) Threshold shift and anti-punch through implants  
      4) Thin oxide and gate polysilicon  
      5) Lightly doped drains and sources  
      6) Sidewall spacer  
      7) Heavily doped drains and sources  
      8) Siliciding (Salicide and Polycide)  
      9) Bottom metal, tungsten plugs, and oxide  
      10) Higher level metals, tungsten plugs/vias, and oxide  
      11) Top level metal, vias and protective oxide   

**Summary of Deep Submicron (DSM) CMOS Fabrication Process**

 <summary>1. List the five basic MOS fabrication processing steps and give the purpose or function of each step.</summary>
  
**Oxidation**  
Oxidation is the process by which a layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is formed on the surface of the silicon wafer. The oxide grows both into as well as on the silicon surface. This oxide is used to provide insulating and passivation layers.  
**Diffusion**  
Diffusion in semiconductor material is the movement of impurity atoms at the surface of the material into the bulk of the material at temperatures in the range of 800–1400°C. The main aim of the Diffusion Process in IC Fabrication is to change the Conductivity of silicon substrate over a depth.  
**Ion implantation**  
Ion implantation is the process by which ions of a particular dopant (impurity) are accelerated by an electric field to a high velocity and physically lodge within the semiconductor material. Ion implantation doping method used in semiconductors that introduces impurities into a semiconductor wafer, enabling conductivity.  
**Deposition**   
Deposition is layering of additional material on the wafer surface. These layers may be applied at various stages during the manufacturing process in order to form a mask, to act as a new layer for further junction formation, or to form an insulating layer between two or more conductive layers.  
**Etching**  
Etching removes layers of SiO2, metals, and polysilicon, according to the desired patterns delineated by the resist. The two major methods of etching are wet chemical etching or dry chemical etching.  
</details>
 <details>
 <summary>2. What is the difference between positive and negative photoresist and how is photoresist used?</summary>
  
Positive photoresists undergo weakening when exposed to irradiation, whereas negative photoresists are strengthened. Positive photoresist is used to create a mask where patterns exist (where the photomask is opaque to UV light). Negative photoresist creates a mask where patterns do not exist (where the photomask is transparent to UV light).

 <summary>7. What is the difference between LOCOS and STI process?</summary>

The STI process starts in the same way as the LOCOS process. A shallow trench is etched into the silicon substrate in STI. After underetching of the oxide pad, also a thermal oxide in the trench is grown, the so-called liner oxide. But unlike with LOCOS, the thermal oxidation process is stopped after the formation of a thin oxide layer, and the rest of the trench is filled with a deposited oxide

 <summary>8. Why for body connection a heavily doped n+ or p+ is used?</summary>
  
A heavily doped N+ or P+ diffusion is made for the metallic contact. This creates a conductive junction between the metal and the semiconductor, thus giving a good electrical contact to the bulk.

 <summary>13. What are the advantages of Deep N-well technology over n-well technology?</summary>

The deep N well has the effect of decreasing the noise coupling through it to the substrate and giving the advantage of fully isolated NMOS devices while in n-well, capacitive coupling of noise from the well to the substrate means more noise reaches the supply.

 <summary>15. What is Bird’s beak in LOCOS process and what is the impact on the transistor performance?</summary>
 
A bird's beak effect is commonplace in LOCOS. As the oxide grows, the nitride mask, which is meant to block the oxide from growing everywhere, is slightly bent due to stress caused by the oxide pushing the nitride as it grows. The encroachment of field oxide in the active region reduces the area available to form a transistor and therefore it limits device scaling and device density in VLSI cuts which will limit the device performance.
